### Hi there 👋

If you were born and raised in Japan and can only speak Japanese properly, I have no time for you.

We don't need people who don't know the difference between ”a literal translation” and ”an implied translation”, who don't consider ”UX and nuance”, and who only care about UI in ”localization”.
